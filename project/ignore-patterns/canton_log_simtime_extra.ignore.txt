# Extra patterns to ignore when using Canton with simtime
# See 'canton_log.ignore.txt' for details on how to write these.

# This works around issues in simtime where in-flight requests
# end up timing out when we concurrently advance time.
The estimated sequencing time .* is already past the max sequencing time
# variant of the above for aggregate submissions
Max sequencing time.*for submission.*is already past the sequencer clock timestamp
Submission timed out at
Rejected transaction due to a participant determined timeout
# This is also present in canton_log.ignore.txt, except in simtime, it happens on non-SV participants too
Response message for request.*timed out at

The payload to event time bound.*has been been exceeded by payload time
# Canton GenericStepsError(SequencerTimeoutError) errors and failures caused by it
Failed to submit submission due to GenericStepsError.*SequencerTimeoutError

# advancing time can result in the sequencer subscriptions being expired (See #7980)
SEQUENCER_SUBSCRIPTION_LOST.*: Lost subscription to domain .* Will try to recover automatically.

# It seems this happens when a transaction is in-flight and we advance time. We should just retry.
INTERPRETATION_TIME_EXCEEDED.*: Interpretation time exceeds limit of Ledger Effective Time
