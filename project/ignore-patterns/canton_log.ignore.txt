# Patterns of entries to be ignored when checking the canton log file (sbt checkErrors).
# As the Canton log appenders emit errors/warnings to stdout, the patterns listed here will also be applied when checking the sbt output.
# Patterns must be both
# - PCRE regular expressions (see https://regex101.com) and
# - extended regular expressions as used by "grep -E -e".
# Lines containing only blanks or lines starting with '#' are ignored.

# ExecutionContextMonitor
Task runner .* is .* overloaded

# This may sometimes lead to subsequent errors (e.g. api server fails to startup), but quite often it can simply be ignored.
Trying to gather entropy from the underlying operating system to initialized the contract ID seeding, but the entropy pool seems empty.
In CI environments environment consider using the "testing-weak" mode, that may produce insecure contract IDs but does not block on startup.

# Sometimes pops up in the Canton logs. This can happen
