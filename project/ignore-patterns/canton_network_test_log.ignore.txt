# Patterns of entries to be ignored when checking the canton_network_test log file (sbt checkErrors).
# As the Canton log appenders emit errors/warnings to stdout, the patterns listed here will also be applied when checking the sbt output.
# Patterns must be both
# - PCRE regular expressions (see https://regex101.com) and
# - extended regular expressions as used by "grep -E -e".
# Lines containing only blanks or lines starting with '#' are ignored.

# This may sometimes lead to subsequent errors (e.g. api server fails to startup), but quite often it can simply be ignored.
