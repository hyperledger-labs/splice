# Errors and warnings caused by the key rotation in ManualSignatureIntegrationTest

# ensureOwnerToKeyMapping does not wait an approximate time of 2 sequencing ordering latency
# between the two transactions that rotates the keys. We are therefore getting the following warning.
# Fine to ignore as the retry eventually ends.
.*could not verify client's signature.*

.*used to generate signature is not a valid key.*
.*Response message for request.* timed out.*
.*Now retrying operation 'request current time'.*
