## Check for 'fetch' invocations in Daml code

# Note, there might be the alternative to enlist the help of `damlc lint` (built on hlint) to check for
# these invocations of 'fetch' using a custom rule: https://github.com/ndmitchell/hlint/blob/master/README.md#adding-hints
#
# However the grep-based code below is nice and simple, which is why we're using it for now.
