      properties:
        choiceArguments:
          type: object
          description: |
            The arguments that are intended to be passed to the choice provided by the factory.
            To avoid repeating the Daml type definitions, they are specified as JSON objects.
            However the concrete format is given by how the choice arguments are encoded using the Daml JSON API
            (with the `extraArgs.context` and `extraArgs.meta` fields set to the empty object).

            The choice arguments are provided so that the registry can also provide choice-argument
            specific contracts, e.g., the configuration for a specific instrument-id.

          description: "If set to true, the response will not include fields prefixed with 'debug'. Useful to save bandwidth."

            Metadata that will be passed to the choice, and should be incorporated

    TransferFactoryWithChoiceContext:
      description: |
        The transfer factory contract together with the choice context required to exercise the choice
        provided by the factory. Typically used to implement the generic initiation of on-ledger workflows
        via a Daml interface.

        Clients SHOULD avoid reusing the same `FactoryWithChoiceContext` for exercising multiple choices,
        as the choice context MAY be specific to the choice being exercised.
      type: object
      properties:
        factoryId:
          description: "The contract ID of the contract implementing the factory interface."
          type: string
        transferKind:
          description: |
            The kind of transfer workflow that will be used:
            * `offer`: offer a transfer to the receiver and only transfer if they accept
            * `direct`: transfer directly to the receiver without asking them for approval.
              Only chosen if the receiver has pre-approved direct transfers.
            * `self`: a self-transfer where the sender and receiver are the same party.
              No approval is required, and the transfer is typically immediate.
          type: string
          enum:
            - "self"

    ChoiceContext:
      description: |
        The context required to exercise a choice on a contract via an interface.
        Used to retrieve additional reference data that is passed in via disclosed contracts,
        which are in turn referred to via their contract ID in the `choiceContextData`.

            The contracts that are required to be disclosed to the participant node for exercising
            the choice.

            The name of the Daml package that was used to create the contract.
