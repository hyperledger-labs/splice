  title: Transfer preapproval management off-ledger API
  description: |
    Implemented by token registries for the purpose of managing the set
    of transfer preapprovals.

    These preapprovals will be used to determine how to best execute a
    transfer instructed via the separate transfer-preapproval API.

            To avoid repeating the Daml type definitions, they are specified as JSON objects.
            However the concrete format is given by how the choice arguments are encoded using the Daml JSON API
            (with the `extraArgs.context` and `extraArgs.meta` fields set to the empty object).

            The choice arguments are provided so that the registry can also provide choice-argument
            specific contracts, e.g., the configuration for a specific instrument-id.
