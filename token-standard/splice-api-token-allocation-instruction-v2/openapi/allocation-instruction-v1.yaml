          type: object
          description: |
            The arguments that are intended to be passed to the choice provided by the factory.
            To avoid repeating the Daml type definitions, they are specified as JSON objects.
            However the concrete format is given by how the choice arguments are encoded using the Daml JSON API
            (with the `extraArgs.context` and `extraArgs.meta` fields set to the empty object).

            The choice arguments are provided so that the registry can also provide choice-argument
            specific contracts, e.g., the configuration for a specific instrument-id.

    FactoryWithChoiceContext:
      description: |
        A factory contract together with the choice context required to exercise the choice
        provided by the factory. Typically used to implement the generic initiation of on-ledger workflows
        via a Daml interface.

        Clients SHOULD avoid reusing the same `FactoryWithChoiceContext` for exercising multiple choices,
        as the choice context MAY be specific to the choice being exercised.

    ChoiceContext:
      description: |
        The context required to exercise a choice on a contract via an interface.
        Used to retrieve additional reference date that is passed in via disclosed contracts,
        which are in turn referred to via their contract ID in the `choiceContextData`.
