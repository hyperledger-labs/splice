  Upload logs.
  We put this in a separate action and not as part of post_sbt so that it can be called
  only upon failure. Conditioning a single step inside the action on `failure()` does not
  seem to capture the failure condition of the whole workflow :(

inputs:
  name:
    description: "Name of the artifact"
    required: false
    default: log

  using: 'composite'

        if [[ -d log ]]; then
          # pigz fails if there is no file to compress, which can be the case if Canton just rolled its logs
          pigz -r log/* || true
        fi
