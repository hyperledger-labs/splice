# Docker Hooks

## Description
This implementation mirrors the original docker implementation in the [Actions Runner](https://github.com/actions/runner). 

Feel free to fork this repo and modify it in order to customize that implementation

## Pre-requisites 
The `GITHUB_WORKSPACE` env will be set to the GitHub Workspace. This is done automatically by the actions runner, but may need to be done manually when testing
The docker cli is installed on the machine, and docker is running.
