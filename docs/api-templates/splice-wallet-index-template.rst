splice-wallet docs
==================

Note that these are internal modules to implement the Canton Coin specific wallet funcationality
in the :ref:`Splice Wallet <validator-users>` served by a :ref:`Validator Node <validator_operator>`.
Avoid referencing these models in your own Daml code, as no guarantees are made about their stability
and upgrade cadence.

For implementing a wallet of your own, compose with the interfaces defined as part of the
:ref:`Canton Network Token Standard <app_dev_token_standard_overview>`.
