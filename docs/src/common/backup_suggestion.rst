.. warning::

    **If you lose your keys, you lose access to your coins**. While regular backups are not necessary to run your node,
    they are **strongly** recommended for recovery purposes.
    You should regularly back up all databases in your deployment and ensure you always have an up-to-date identity backup.
    Super Validators retain the information necessary to allow you to recover your Canton Coin from an identity backup.
    On the other hand, Super Validators **do not** retain transaction details from applications they are not involved in.
    This means that if you have other applications installed, the Super Validators cannot help you recover data from those apps;
    you can only rely on your own backups.
    (More information in :ref:`Backups section for Validators <validator-backups>` or :ref:`Backups section for SVs <sv_backups>`)
