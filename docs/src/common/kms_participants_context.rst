By default, Canton participants use cryptographic `keys <https://docs.daml.com/canton/usermanual/security.html>`_ that are generated by the participant itself and stored in the regular database used by the participant.
To improve key security, participants can be configured to use an external Key Management System (KMS) to generate and store keys.
Please consult the official `Canton documentation on KMS support <https://docs.daml.com/canton/usermanual/kms/kms.html>`_ for additional details and a list of supported KMS providers.
Participants deployed as part of a Splice deployment support the `External Key Storage <https://docs.daml.com/canton/usermanual/kms/external_key_storage/external_key_storage.html>`_ mode of KMS usage.
