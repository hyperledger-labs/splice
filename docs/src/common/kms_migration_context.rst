It is not supported to migrate an existing participant from "non-KMS-based" to "KMS-based" operation, or to migrate from one KMS provider to another.
The main reason for this is that a participant's root namespace key cannot be rotated,
and importing it from a potentially unsafe location into a KMS would diminish the security gain of using the KMS.
Moreover, some KMS providers do not support importing existing keys at all and can only be used for managing keys generated by the KMS itself.
