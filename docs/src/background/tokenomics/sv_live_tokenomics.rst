Super Validator Rewards
=======================


Each Super Validator, in each round, creates an
:ref:`SvRewardCoupon <type-splice-amulet-svrewardcoupon-68580>`.

These SV minting rights are granted by the tokenomics committee in exchange for operating an SV node or contributing key infrastructure or activity to the network.
The tokenomics committee uses the CIP process to record the SV rights. The current list of SV rights is thus available from the `CIP repo <https://github.com/global-synchronizer-foundation/cips>`__.
