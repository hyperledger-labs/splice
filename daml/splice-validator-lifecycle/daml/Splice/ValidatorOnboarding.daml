-- | Template used by a sponsoring SV node to keep track of the onboarding of a validator candidate.
-- We use a secret for authenticating the candidate once he has set up his participant.
-- The secret should be unique, contain at least 256-bits of entropy,
-- and be communicated to the candidate via a secure off-ledger channel.
-- Once the candidate has set up his participants, he contacts the SV node via an API call
-- and presents his secret, which triggers the SV node to add him as a validator
-- (as a separate on-ledger action for reducing coupling with the DSO governance contracts).
