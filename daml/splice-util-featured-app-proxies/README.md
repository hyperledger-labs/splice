# Proxy contracts for delegating the usage of featured app rights

This is a convenience package that provides proxy contracts that allow for the
delegation of featured app rights to other parties for the usage of token
standard workflows.
Use them to earn app rewards on token standard operations, and to share some of
them with your users.

Note that this package is not uploaded by default to a validator node.
You need to upload it yourself if you want to use it.

You can rely on different splice releases to evolve this package in a backwards compatible way.
