-- | Templates and support code for reward accounting based on off-ledger calculations, as initially
-- described in CIP-104 for traffic-based app rewards.
--
-- It is a Version 2 compared to the previous reward accounting mechanism that is based on tracking
-- all state on-ledger using App|Validator|SvRewardCoupon and IssuingMiningRound contracts.
module Splice.Amulet.RewardAccountingV2 where

import DA.Action (unless)
import DA.Foldable (forA_)

import Splice.Amulet.CryptoHash qualified as CryptoHash

import Splice.AmuletConfig
import Splice.Types
import Splice.Util

{- TODO

overall:
- remove AmuletRules_ClaimExpiredRewards; and add missing getAndValidateSvParty calls to DsoRules_ClaimExpiredRewards
  - add checked fetches for all coupons in ClaimExpiredRewards
- check naming to prepare for a change where more reward issuance works through this mechanism (e.g. SV and validator rewards)
  - e.g., name `GenericRewardCoupon` and pull that through

splice-amulet:

- decide whether we even need AppRewardV2
  - main motivation: batched minting
  - adjust amulet rules transfer to support RewardsV2V2
- introduce ExternalAmuletRules_MintWithBeneficiaries
  - add API package for it


splice-dso:
- switch to iterated committments to enable bounded-size batches

releas notes:
- call out cycling of featured app rights; and markers created during switch-over time

Notes for apps:

- wallet:
  - collect RewardCouponV2



Notes on design:
- roll-out
  - enable dry-run of RAV_V2
    ==> app reward calculation will be simulated, but no app reward coupons will be issued
  - enable RAV_V2 for real
    ==> all open rounds at this point will use RAV_V2
    ==> activity markers will be dropped by trigger
    ==> featured app rights
