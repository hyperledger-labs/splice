        Requests the creation of a new ANS entry.
        ANS entries need to be paid and renewed via subscription payments.

        Upon requesting the creation of the ANS entry, a subscription request is created.
        The user may accept the subscription request via their wallet by offering the initial payment.
        Once the subscription request is accepted, the DSO automation burns the payment and creates the ANS entry.
