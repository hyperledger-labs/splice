        As an authenticated user, onboard yourself.
        Onboarding includes allocating a ledger API user and daml party,
        and setting up daml contracts required for the user to use a wallet on this validator.

        The ledger API user name is taken from the subject claim of the JWT token.

        Once this call returns a successful response, the user is fully onboarded.
        Use [v0/wallet/user-status](../../../../wallet/src/main/openapi/wallet-internal.yaml#/paths/v0/wallet/user-status)
        to check the status of the user onboarding.
