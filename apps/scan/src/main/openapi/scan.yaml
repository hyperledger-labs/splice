        Updates are ordered lexicographically by `(migration id, record time)`.
        For a given migration id, each update has a unique record time.
        The record time ranges of different migrations may overlap, i.e.,
        it is not guaranteed that the maximum record time of one migration is smaller than the minimum record time of the next migration,

        Returns the event history in ascending order, paged, from ledger begin or optionally starting after a record time.
        An event bears some combination of a transaction, a contract reassignment, and a verdict.
        Events are ordered lexicographically by `(migration id, record time)`.
        For a given migration id, each event has a unique record time.
        The record time ranges of different migrations may overlap, i.e.,
        it is not guaranteed that the maximum record time of one migration is smaller than the minimum record time of the next migration,
        and there may be two updates with the same record time but different migration ids.
