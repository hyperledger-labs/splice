  # The same party id can be specified multiple times and the amounts are added up.
  #
  # It can be useful to specify more beneficiaries than your current weight allows to account for an upcoming weight change, e.g., specifying
  # beneficiary X once with weight X and then once with weight Y at the end will mean that this party will get weight X until your weight
  # increases to allow for it to receive up to X+Y.
