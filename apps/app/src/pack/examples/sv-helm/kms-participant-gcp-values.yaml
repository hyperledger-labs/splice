# Example for configuring authentication to the GCP KMS.
# Adds an env var on the participant pod that points to the location of the Google
# credentials file and mounts that file as a volume, reading its contents from a secret.
# In order for this to work as-is, you need to create the appropriate k8s secret
# and ensure that it holds the contents of a valid Google credentials file
# (under the `googleCredentials` key).
