# Only for SV validators:
# if you want to configure validator to connect to a single trusted sequencer, set ``useSequencerConnectionsFromScan`` to false.
# and replace ``TRUSTED_SYNCHRONIZER_SEQUENCER_URL`` with the publicly accessible URL of the trusted sequencer.
# This does mean that you depend on that single SV and if it is broken or malicious you will be unable to use the network so usually you want to default to not enabling this.
# decentralizedSynchronizerUrl: "TRUSTED_SYNCHRONIZER_SEQUENCER_URL"
# useSequencerConnectionsFromScan: false

# Replace OPERATOR_WALLET_USER_ID with the user id in your IAM that you want to use to log into
# the wallet as the SV party. Note that this should be the full user id, e.g., ``auth0|43b68e1e4978b000cefba352``
# not only the suffix ``43b68e1e4978b000cefba352``:
# You can specify multiple user ids if you want multiple users to be able to log into your wallet.
# Note that removing a user from this list does *not* revoke any access that the user might already have; you might want to manually `/admin/users/offboard` the user via the validator app API.

# SWEEP_START
# If you want funds sweeped out of parties in this validator, uncomment and fill in the following:
#walletSweep:
#  "<senderPartyId>":
#    maxBalanceUSD: <maxBalanceUSD>
#    minBalanceUSD: <minBalanceUSD>
#    receiver: "<receiverPartyId>"
#    useTransferPreapproval: false # sweep by transferring directly through the transfer preapproval of the receiver,
#                                    if set to false sweeping creates transfer offers that need to be accepted on the receiver side.
#                                    Note that this refers to the preapprovals described in https://docs.dev.sync.global/background/preapprovals.html
#                                    and not to auto accepting transfers. Auto accept transfers does not setup preapproval contracts that allow
#                                    for a direct transfer but just automates the acceptance of the transfer offer so in that case
#                                    useTransferPreapproval should be set to false.

#  "<receiverPartyId>":

#      - "<senderPartyId>"
# AUTO_ACCEPT_END

# Contact point for your validator node that can be used by other node operators
