# CONFIGURING_TOPUP_START
# Configuring a validator's traffic top-up loop
#
# enabled - set to false in order to disable automatic traffic top-ups.
# targetThroughput - target throughput in bytes / second of sequenced traffic. targetThroughput=0 <=> enabled=false
# minTopupInterval - minimum time interval that must elapse before the next top-up.
#
# On each successful top-up, an amount of traffic roughly equivalent to `targetThroughput * minTopupInterval`
# (possibly with some rounding-up), referred to as the top-up amount, is purchased. The `minTopupInterval` allows
# validator operators to control the frequency at which automated top-ups happen. Note that the actual top-up amount
# and top-up interval might be larger due to the DSO requiring a minimal top-up amount larger than `targetThroughput * minTopupInterval`.
#
# The next top-up gets triggered when:
# - the available traffic amount drops below the configured top-up amount
# - at least minTopupInterval has elapsed since the last one
# - the validator has sufficient CC in its wallet to buy this much traffic (except on DevNet)

# SWEEP_START
# If you want funds sweeped out of parties in this validator, uncomment and fill in the following:

#    receiver: "<receiverPartyId>"

# AUTO_ACCEPT_START
# To configure the validator to auto-accept transfer offers from specific parties, uncomment and fill in the following:
#autoAcceptTransfers:
#  "<receiverPartyId>"
#    fromParties:
#      - "<senderPartyId>"
# AUTO_ACCEPT_END
