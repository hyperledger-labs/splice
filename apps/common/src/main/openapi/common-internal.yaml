        Always created with respect to an input set of contract IDs. If an input
        contract ID is absent from the keys of this map, that contract should be
        considered removed by the caller; if present, `contract` may be empty,
        reflecting that the caller should already have the full contract data
        for that contract ID. Contracts not present in the input set will have
        full contract data. `domain_id` is always up-to-date; if undefined the
        contract is currently unassigned to a synchronizer, i.e. "in-flight".
