# TODO(XX): delete this file once the base version of upgrade tests is 0.4.18 (after we cut the release)

# This file is empty on purpose, it is not really in use, but make breaks if it does not exist.
# In upgrade tests, we use a base splice version, but still latest cn-internal, so makefiles in splice fail to find this file.
# We don't really need its content, as we don't test expected files in this scenario.
