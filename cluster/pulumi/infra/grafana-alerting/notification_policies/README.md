## Notification policies

Our alert routing is determined by the optional `team` label attached to our alerts:
- the Canton Network team gets notifications from all alerts **except** the ones that have the label `team = support`.
- the Support team gets only notifications from alerts that have the labels `team = da` or  `team = shared`.
