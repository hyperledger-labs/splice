# <list> The labels by which incoming alerts are grouped together. For example,
#        multiple alerts coming in for cluster=A and alertname=LatencyHigh would
#        be batched into a single group.
#
#        To aggregate by all possible labels use the special value '...' as
#        the sole label name, for example:
#        group_by: ['...']
#        This effectively disables aggregation entirely, passing through all
#        alerts as-is. This is unlikely to be what you want, unless you have
#        a very low alert volume or your upstream notification system performs
#        its own grouping.
#    group_by: ['...']
#    # <list> a list of prometheus-like matchers that an alert rule has to fulfill to match the node (allowed chars
#    #        [a-zA-Z_:])
#    matchers:
#      - alertname = Watchdog
#      - service_id_X = serviceX
#      - severity =~ "warning|critical"
#    # <list> a list of grafana-like matchers that an alert rule has to fulfill to match the node
object_matchers:
  - ['team', '!=', 'support']
#      - ['service_id-X', '=', 'serviceX']
#      - ['severity', '=~', 'warning|critical']
#    # <list> Times when the route should be muted. These must match the name of a
#    #        mute time interval.
#    #        Additionally, the root node cannot have any mute times.
#    #        When a route is muted it will not send any notifications, but
#    #        otherwise acts normally (including ending the route-matching process
#    #        if the `continue` option is not set)
#    mute_time_intervals:
#      - abc
# <duration> How long to initially wait to send a notification for a group
#            of alerts. Allows to collect more initial alerts for the same group.
#            (Usually ~0s to few minutes), default = 30s
group_wait: 30s
# <duration> How long to wait before sending a notification about new alerts that
#            are added to a group of alerts for which an initial notification has
#            already been sent. (Usually ~5m or more), default = 5m
group_interval: 10m
# <duration>  How long to wait before sending a notification again if it has already
#             been sent successfully for an alert. (Usually ~3h or more), default = 4h
repeat_interval: 4h
